I am Felipe Concha, a Structural Civil Engineer with a Master's in Computational Mechanics. Currently, I'm deepening my expertise in 
Machine Learning through my PhD research, focusing on its application to computational models. Beyond academia, I've channeled my knowledge 
into the entrepreneurial realm, founding a startup dedicated to AI-driven structural optimization. With a solid foundation in engineering,
advanced computational skills, and a track record of innovation, I'm eager to explore opportunities where I can apply this multidisciplinary 
expertise to address real-world challenges.
